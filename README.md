This is a repository for me to practice with Bayesian Optimization

**1_random_forest_tuning/random_forest_tuning.ipynb**: Using Ax's Bayesian Optimization for the hyperparameter tuning of a Random Forest Classifier to predict the edibility of mushrooms.

**2_docking_predictor_tuning/docking_predictors_opt.ipynb**: Using Ax's Bayesian Optimization (Service API) for the hyperparameter tuning of several Extra Trees Regressors to predict different scores related to the docking of molecules onto CYP2D6.
